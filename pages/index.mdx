# Hello Vercel

it is my first time to use Vercel, I think it is very nice. I'm writting this code in Vercel Live. and I connenct this project to my own github account. and after that I will commit my first code to see if it will trigger auto deployment. also I'm newer to next.js, I'm trying to learn it more. and will record my step on learing next.js by Vercel and vercel Live.

I have to say it is very useful and inspired me a lot.
